# css-indicators

Pure CSS3 work indicators (a.k.a. Ajax loaders).

## Usage

Download either [the minified](https://raw.github.com/ncuesta/css-indicators/master/build/indicator.min.css) or [the regular](https://raw.github.com/ncuesta/css-indicators/master/build/indicator.css) version of the CSS file and include it in your page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <!-- This is the important bit -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="css/indicator.min.css" />
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

And then add the needed markup for the themed indicator (see below).

## Indicator themes

### Global CSS class names

First of all, you should know that every indicator must have the `.indicator` class
name.

For every indicator theme you can specify its size via a class name. This is optional,
and will default to a sensible value. Available sizes are: `.small`, `.medium`,
`.normal` (the default size), `.large` and `.x-large`.

### Spinner

This theme displays an animated spinner with bars.

#### The markup

This indicator requires the following markup (please note that the specific classes
described in the next section might change for your particular use case):

```html
<!-- The spinner needs a container element -->
<span class="indicator spinner normal bars-9">
    <!-- And a set of bars to draw, in this case 9 as .bars-9 requires -->
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
</span>
```

#### The CSS

This indicator uses the `.spinner` class name, and relies on a class that states
the number of bars it should show.

For the number of bars you must use a class that indicates how many bar elements
the spinner has in the form `.bars-X`, where `X` is a number between `3` and `36`.

### Bouncer

This theme displays a nice little ball bouncing up and down in a neverending loop.

#### The markup

This indicator requires the following markup (please note that the specific classes
described in the next section might change for your particular use case):

```html
<!-- The bouncer needs a container element -->
<span class="indicator bouncer normal with-floor">
    <!-- And the ball that will be bouncing inside the container -->
    <span class="ball"></span>
</span>
```

#### The CSS

This indicator uses the `.bouncer` class and can have a floor to give a more
"realistic" look via the optional `.with-floor` class.

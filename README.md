# css-indicators

Pure CSS3 work indicators (a.k.a. Ajax loaders).

## Usage

Download either [the minified](https://raw.github.com/ncuesta/css-indicators/master/build/indicator.min.css) or [the regular](https://raw.github.com/ncuesta/css-indicators/master/build/indicator.css) version of the CSS file and include it in your page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <!-- This is the important bit -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="css/indicator.min.css" />
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

And then add the needed markup for the themed indicator (see below).

## Indicator themes

### Spinner

This theme displays an animated spinner with bars.

#### The markup

This indicator requires the following markup (please note that the specific classes
described in the next section might change for your particular use case):

```html
<!-- The spinner needs a container element -->
<span class="spinner normal bars-9">
    <!-- And a set of bars to draw, in this case 9 as .bars-9 requires -->
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
    <span class="bar"></span>
</span>
```

#### The CSS

This indicator uses the `.spinner` class name, and relies on two groups of classes
to define its particular looks: one for the size and another one for the number of
bars it should show.

For the size (this one is optional) you can either use: `.small`, `.medium`,
`.normal` (the default size), `.large` and `.x-large`.

For the number of bars you must use a class that indicates how many bar elements
the spinner has in the form `.bars-X`, where `X` is a number between `3` and `36`.
